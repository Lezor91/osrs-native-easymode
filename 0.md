**Starting off**

Step 1. Search for 999999999. You should end up with very few results. The function we are looking for should resemble this <https://pastebin.com/UJ1SKram>

Step 2. If you aren't aware, this method is responsible for executing cs1 (client script version 1). Every if statement comparing iVar5 to a number is comparing the opcode. You can already identify a lot here in each opcode block

Opcode 1 = current level

Opcode 2 = base level

Opcode 3 = skill experience

Opcode 4 = components

Opcode 5 = varps

Opcode 8 = local player, combat level

Opcode 11 = player energy

Opcode 12 = player weight

Opcode 14 = varbits

Opcode 18 = scene base x, actor absolute x

Opcode 19 = scene base y, actor absolute y

As the code in opcodes 18 and 19 demonstrates, you simply shift the absolute coord right by 7 and add the scene base onto it. i.e your real x coord would be `(player->absX >> 7) + baseX`
